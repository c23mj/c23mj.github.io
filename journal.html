<h1>CS1 Coding Journal - Michael Jiang</h1>
Hello, this is my coding journal. I'll be writing in this every once in a while.
<p>
Saturday, 10/19. Today I tried working on my room assignment but somehow my background for my body section works only when there's no other commands on the background. Also (obviously) writing in this journal.
</p>
<p>
Saturday, 10/26, Worked again on roomassignment but I think i'm stuck so I need to lab. Mocked up and thought more about room project.</p>
<p>
Tuesday, 10/29, Labbed for my basic room project, learned a command to create repeated squares (in Java).
</p>
<p>
Thursday, 11/21, Wrote and finished the introduction assignment to javascript functions and linked it to my personal website. I already labbed prior about javascript functions, so this wasn't too new to me, and all the dumplings started to make me hungry. Need to reschedule a new lab (hopefully weekly).
</p>
<p>Monday, 11/25, Labbed with Molly over project once again, got further with array thing. Also, mocked up FizzBuzz w/o coding.
</p>
<p>
Mockup for Fizz Buzz
For I = 1 to 100
If I mod 3>0 and I mod 5>0 print I
If I mod 3 ==0 and I mod 5>0 print fizz
If I mod 3 > 0 and I mod 5 == 0 print buzz
If I mod 3 == 0 and I mod 5 == 0 print fizzbuzz </p>
<p>Wednesday, 12/18 -- Hi! I really haven't updated this a very long time, but I've done a few things: Labbed a lot more with Molly about my project that we're still kinda struggling with, and created a fizzbuzz and another Javascript function. I haven't pushed in a crazy long time, so here we are! As for frustrations in the past, my projectedt is definitely still a huge thing that I have been working on for a pretty long time without making that much progress. Fizzbuzz came relatively easyto me, and the new Javascript Function that I coded which is about converting degrees from farenheit to celsius taught me about inputs which is really exciting!</p>
<p> Thursday, 1/18: Today I completed another codesketch, which is a die roller using an array. </p>
<p> Monday, 1/27: Today I worked on the "swarming things" project, I don't really know what it's even called at this point. It's been a while since I have properly coded, so I refreshed myself and created a for loop to create a bunch of rectangles. <p> 
<p> Friday, 1/31: Today I made the rectangles different colors and was trying to work on making the divs disappear. I believe that it should have to do something with event listeners and opacity, but I haven't really figured it out yet. </p>
<p> Sunday, 2/2: I've gotten to a point where I now have different color divs positioned one after another that are randomish colors and individually disappear, but I need to set the whole class to dissapear. </p>
<p> Thursday, 2/29: I've decided that I will be working on this math game called the Tower of Hanoi that the compsci floor has a physical copy of. Working on a mockup.</p>
<p> Thursday, 3/5: Finished my mockup, but I've kinda been sick all week so I couldn't schedule a lab until tomorrow, but I guess I wont remember to push this journal until afterwards so oops. </p>
