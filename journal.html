<h1>CS1 Coding Journal - Michael Jiang</h1>
Hello, this is my coding journal. I'll be writing in this every once in a while.
<p>
Saturday, 10/19. Today I tried working on my room assignment but somehow my background for my body section works only when there's no other commands on the background. Also (obviously) writing in this journal.
</p>
<p>
Saturday, 10/26, Worked again on roomassignment but I think i'm stuck so I need to lab. Mocked up and thought more about room project.</p>
<p>
Tuesday, 10/29, Labbed for my basic room project, learned a command to create repeated squares (in Java).
</p>
<p>
Thursday, 11/21, Wrote and finished the introduction assignment to javascript functions and linked it to my personal website. I already labbed prior about javascript functions, so this wasn't too new to me, and all the dumplings started to make me hungry. Need to reschedule a new lab (hopefully weekly).
