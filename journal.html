<h1>CS1 Coding Journal - Michael Jiang</h1>
Hello, this is my coding journal. I'll be writing in this every once in a while.
<p>
Saturday, 10/19, 4:42 PM. Today I tried working on my room assignment but somehow my background for my body section works only when there's no other commands on the background. Also (obviously) writing in this journal.
